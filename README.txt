WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
This is a helper program to enable keyboard controls on the
Subway Surfers game for Windows.


WHY DO I NEED THIS?
-------------------
For some reason, the input configuration for Subway Surfers
isn't working even if you set it to the corresponding keys.
As a result, you end up being forced to click on the mouse
and then drag to the direction you need. Pretty clunky for
non-touch devices.


HOW DO I USE THIS?
------------------
Just place SubwaySurfersKeyboardMapper.exe in the same
folder as the Subway Surfers game. THat's where the game's
main executable (Subway_surfers.exe) is located.

This will make it possible to control your character using
the WASD and/or the arrow keys on the keyboard.


ARE YOU AFFILIATED WITH SUBWAY SURFERS DEVELOPERS?
--------------------------------------------------
No. This is not endorsed nor supported by them. Made this
just so my life goes easier while playing it and I wanted
to share it for those that need it.


IS THIS SAFE?
-------------
I've included the source code. It's in the 'src' folder.
It is fully documented and you can compile it yourself if
you want.
